        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p class="disclaimer">Please note that our handwriting classification system utilizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to analyze and identify handwriting styles. While our program strives to provide accurate results, it's important to understand that no system can guarantee 100% accuracy. Handwriting can vary greatly, and our AI model may occasionally produce results that are not entirely precise. Therefore, we encourage users to interpret the output with discretion and consider it as a close estimation rather than an absolute determination. We continuously work to improve the accuracy of our system and appreciate your understanding as we evolve our technology.</p>

    <h2>Here are some tips for improving handwriting:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Like any skill, handwriting improves with practice. Set aside time each day to practice writing neatly and consistently.</li>
      <li>Grip the pen or pencil with your fingers, not too tightly, and ensure a comfortable and relaxed grip. Experiment with different grips to find what works best for you.</li>
      <li>Periodically review your handwriting and identify areas for improvement. Reflect on what techniques are working well and where you can make adjustments.</li>
